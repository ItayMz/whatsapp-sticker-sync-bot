# ðŸ¤– WhatsApp Sticker Forwarding Bot

This is a Node.js-powered WhatsApp bot that automatically forwards stickers between a predefined set of WhatsApp groups. It uses the `whatsapp-web.js` library to connect via WhatsApp Web and synchronize sticker sharing across groups, making it easy for multiple sticker-sharing communities to stay in sync. The bot listens for incoming sticker messages in any group whose name matches one of the defined target groups (by default: "C1", "C2", "C3", "C4"). When a sticker is sent in one group, the bot automatically forwards it as a sticker to each of the other groups. It does this by downloading the media and resending it using the same format. The authentication process uses `LocalAuth`, which means your session is saved locally and does not require scanning the QR code every time unless the session is cleared. When the bot is started for the first time, it displays a QR code in the terminal. You can scan this code from WhatsApp (Linked Devices > Link a Device) to authenticate the bot. After authentication, it will begin listening for messages. Note that the bot does not currently support deletion logic, message logging, or any commandsâ€”it simply detects stickers and forwards them across the other groups. Itâ€™s ideal for lightweight use cases where all you want is to keep sticker sharing unified across multiple chats. To deploy, clone the project, run `npm install`, and then execute `node index.js` to start the bot. Make sure the WhatsApp account being used has been added to all target groups as a member. This project can be deployed locally or on platforms like Replit with minimal configuration. Keep in mind that if you're deploying on a remote environment like Replit, you may want to handle QR code scanning and session persistence appropriately using the `.wwebjs_auth` folder. This version is designed to be simple, focused, and easy to extend with features like message deletion, command handling, or sticker logging in the future.
